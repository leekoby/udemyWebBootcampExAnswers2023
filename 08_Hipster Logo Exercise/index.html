<!-- Hipster Logo Exercise
I'm opening up a very hip artisanal vodka company called Purple Grain. Please help complete my incredibly ugly logo. Style the <h1> with the following styles:

uppercase all the letters, without touching the html! (note: you weren't taught how to do this, you will need to flex your googling skills)

set the font-family to be 'monospace'

center align the text

set the font weight to 100

make the text size 40px

set spacing between letters to 20px

add a wavy plum underline (plum is the color) - I can't test this, but make sure it looks like the image!
